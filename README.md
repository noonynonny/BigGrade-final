# BigGrade Netlify Wrapper

A simple redirect page for BigGrade hosted on Netlify that seamlessly directs users to the BigGrade application on Base44.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository provides a branded entry point at `biggrade.netlify.app` that automatically redirects users to the BigGrade application at `biggrade0.base44.app`.

## ✅ Solution

After testing various approaches to embed the Base44 app in an iframe, we determined that **Google OAuth cannot work in iframes** due to security restrictions (`X-Frame-Options: deny`). 

The final solution is a **simple redirect page** that:
- Shows a branded loading screen
- Automatically redirects to the Base44 app in 0.1 seconds
- Provides a manual "Go to BigGrade" button as fallback
- Allows Google Sign-In to work perfectly

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User visits `https://biggrade.netlify.app/`
2. Sees a branded "Redirecting..." page with BigGrade logo
3. Automatically redirected to `https://biggrade0.base44.app`
4. Can sign in with Google without any issues
5. Full app functionality works normally

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why Not Use an Iframe?

We initially attempted to embed the Base44 app in an iframe, but encountered these issues:

1. **Google OAuth Blocking**: Google sets `X-Frame-Options: deny` on their OAuth pages, preventing them from loading in any iframe
2. **No Workaround**: No combination of iframe sandbox permissions can override this security policy
3. **Browser Extensions**: Some extensions (like redirect blockers) interfere with iframe navigation
4. **Complexity**: Iframe wrappers add unnecessary complexity and potential points of failure

### Why Direct Redirect Works

- ✅ No iframe restrictions
- ✅ Google OAuth works perfectly
- ✅ Simple, maintainable code
- ✅ Universal browser support
- ✅ Fast loading time
- ✅ Professional user experience

## 🧪 Testing

The solution has been tested and verified:

1. ✅ Redirect works automatically
2. ✅ Fallback button works if auto-redirect fails
3. ✅ Google Sign-In works without errors
4. ✅ OAuth flow completes successfully
5. ✅ Users can access the full BigGrade app

## 📝 Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to Netlify when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
